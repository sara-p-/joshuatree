                  <h2 class="h3">I woke up around 9am.</h2>
                  <p>
                    We had landed and driven in at night, and had no idea what
                    the area actually looked like.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When I looked our the window I saw a gorgeous landscape of
                    desert plants, surrounded on all sides by stunning
                    mountains.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We took our coffee out to the porch, and spent the morning
                    watching hummingbirds and little lizards dart across the
                    yard. At one point we saw a roadrunner buzzing around in the
                    distance. The weather was in the 70’s with a nice breeze.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We decided that we would go into the Park (Joshua Tree
                    National Park) to watch the sunset, and we picked the Skull
                    Rock Nature Trail as our destination.

                    Sunset at Skull Rock
                  </h1>
                  <h2 class="h3">Our first drive into the park</h2>
                  <p>
                    The drive through the park was wild. Not only was the
                    geology/flora totally different than anything we’d ever
                    seen, but it kept radically changing depending on the
                    altitude.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Skull Rock is part of an area covered in massive boulders
                    and hills, with desert plants growing out of every crevice
                    and crack.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We got out of the car and were shocked at how nice the
                    temperature was. The trail was a sandy trench that meandered
                    around the boulders and outcroppings.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The trail was easy to follow at first, but then just seemed
                    to dissolve into the rocks and we ended up just wandering
                    through the boulders. At one point we climbed up an
                    outcropping and saw tons of cairns everywhere. I cannot
                    fully verbalize how enchanted we were by everything in the
                    landscape. It was magnificent and so entirely different than
                    anything either of us had seen before. By this point the sun
                    was setting and the colors of everything around us were
                    changing too.

                  <p>
                    After the sun set, it started getting dark pretty quickly,
                    and we decided to drive back to our little desert home. We
                    had the windows down so we could feel the cool breeze, and
                    our favorite playlist playing. This was the first day of our
                    trip, and it was already amazing. Our ears popped as we
                    drove back to our Airbnb, and we realized that the Park was
                    at a completely different altitude than our Airbnb.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When we got back we had a beer on the porch, and then
                    started cooking dinner. Our Airbnb was surprisingly
                    well-equipped, and we were able to cook mushroom risotto
                    with pan-seared chicken. It was an unbelievably long
                    process, but we were stoned and didn’t really mind. The end
                    result was fucking delicious, and totally worth it.
